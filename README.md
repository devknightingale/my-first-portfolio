# FCC-Portfolio
This is an offshoot of the personal portfolio I started earlier, but following the "Personal Portfolio" challenge from freeCodeCamp instead just to have a structure to build off of. All the code is completely rewritten from scratch and is not related to the main project. Not sure if/when I will eventually merge the two.
