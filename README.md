# my-first-portfolio
Tracking development of my first portfolio.

I am currently working my way through the Web Development Applications course at WGU. I've found it harder to remember things if I don't try to apply them, so although my degree is going to be in Software Development, I thought it would be helpful to apply the knowledge learned in the Web Development course to create a portfolio website - or at least make the attempt! 

This repository will track my progress through creating my first website.
